# Database-Application
ICS 321: Data Storage and Retrieval, LaptopUps

LaptopUps was a team project created for ICS 321. Our team consisted of Gary Tang (leader), Lap Ho Cheung, and Weng Lam Sio. The project developed and evaluated an application that listed the available CPU upgrades for the user’s Lenovo laptop. This application’s MySQL database was hosted on an Apache Server that we implemented. Four versions of the application were developed; Java, Java with Stored Procedures, C#, and C# with Stored Procedures. We used Intel VTune Amplifier XE 2015 to profile each of these application versions. Data queries and database connection times were also measured. Please refer to the presentation slides for the results and more information.
